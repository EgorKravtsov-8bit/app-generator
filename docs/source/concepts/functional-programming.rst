Functional Programming
======================

Functional programming is a paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data. 
It emphasizes immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions. Key concepts include first-class and higher-order functions, recursion, and lazy evaluation. 
Functional programming can lead to more predictable and testable code, especially in concurrent and parallel processing scenarios.
