Reactive Programming
====================

Reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. 
It emphasizes the creation of event-driven, scalable, and resilient applications. Key concepts include observables, operators, and schedulers. 
Reactive programming is particularly useful in developing responsive user interfaces and handling asynchronous data streams.
