Multitenancy
============

Multitenancy is an architectural concept where a single instance of software serves multiple customers or organizations (tenants). Each tenant's 
data and configuration remain isolated from other tenants, despite sharing the same application and infrastructure resources.

Core Principles of Multitenancy
-------------------------------

1. **Resource Sharing**: Tenants share computing resources, application code, and infrastructure.

2. **Logical Isolation**: Despite sharing resources, each tenant's data and operations remain separated.

3. **Customization**: Tenants can often customize their experience within certain boundaries.

4. **Centralized Administration**: The service provider can manage and update a single system that affects all tenants.


Multitenancy Models
-------------------

1. **Shared Everything**: All tenants share the same application instance and database, with tenant identification at the data level.

2. **Shared Application, Separate Database**: Tenants share the application but have individual databases.

3. **Separate Everything**: Each tenant gets dedicated application instances and databases (closer to single-tenancy).


Benefits of Multitenancy
------------------------

- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduced overhead from sharing infrastructure and maintenance costs.
- **Resource Optimization**: Better resource utilization across all tenants.
- **Simplified Updates**: Updates applied once affect all tenants.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale as tenant base grows.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Centralized monitoring and management.

Challenges
----------

- **Data Isolation**: Ensuring proper security boundaries between tenants.
- **Performance**: Preventing one tenant from negatively impacting others.
- **Customization Limits**: Balancing tenant-specific needs with shared architecture.
- **Complexity**: More complex design and implementation.

Multitenancy is fundamental to most modern SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms, cloud applications, and many enterprise systems. 
Examples include Salesforce, Office 365, and Google Workspace, where many organizations use the same application with their own isolated data and configurations.
