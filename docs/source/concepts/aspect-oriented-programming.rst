Aspect-Oriented Programming
===========================

AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns. 
It does this by adding additional behavior to existing code without modifying the code itself. 
AOP is particularly useful for implementing logging, security, and transaction management across multiple components of an application.
