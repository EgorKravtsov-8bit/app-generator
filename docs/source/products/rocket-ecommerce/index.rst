Building the project
--------------------

It's best to use a Python virtual environment for installing the project dependencies. You can use the following
code to create the virtual environment

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv env

To activate the environment execute `.\env\Scripts\activate.bat` for Windows or `source env/bin/activate` on Linux-based operating systems. 

Having the `VENV` active, we can proceed and install the project dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Core Dependencies
-----------------

The starter requires the following in order to be succesfully started: 

- Python 3.10 (or above)
- (Optional) Git command line - used by the versioning system 
- (Optional) MySql or PostgreSQL DB Servers 
  - if the default SQLite is not enough
- A modern code editor like VsCode or Sublime 

The python version can be easily check in the terminal by typing: 

.. code-block:: bash

    python --version
    Python 3.12.0

Environment Settings  
--------------------

The starter loads the environment variables from `.env` file. Here are the critical ones: 

- **DEBUG**: set by default to False (development mode)
- **SECRET_KEY**: a random value used by Django to secure sensitive information like passwords and cookie information 
- **Database** Credentials: `DB_ENGINE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASS`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`
    - if detected, the database is switched automatically from the default SQLite to the specified DBMS  

Setting up the Database
-----------------------

**By default**, the application **uses SQLite** for persistence. In order to use `MySql`/`PostgreSQL`, you'll need to install the Python driver(s):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install mysqlclient # for MySql
    # OR 
    pip install psycopg2    # for PostgreSQL

To connect the application with your mySQL database, you'll need to fill in the credentials
int the `.env` file and run the migrations.

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: .env

    DB_ENGINE=mysql
    # OR 
    DB_ENGINE=postgresql

    # DB credentials below
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_NAME=<DB_NAME_HERE>
    DB_USERNAME=<DB_USER_HERE>
    DB_PASS=<DB_PASS_HERE>
    DB_PORT=3306

Use the following commands to seed your data:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate

Running the project
-------------------

You can run Dynamic Django locally or deploy it on Render. If you want to run the server locally, you'll need to run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py createsuperuser
    python manage.py runserver

Access the project in your preferred browser and access the dynamic features.
