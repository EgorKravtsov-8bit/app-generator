HTMX is a modern JavaScript library that allows you to access AJAX, CSS transitions, WebSockets, and Server-Sent Events directly in HTML, without writing JavaScript. 
When paired with a backend framework like `Django </docs/technologies/django/index.html>`__, it creates a powerful combination that simplifies building dynamic web applications.

By `using HTMX with Django </docs/products/django/rocket-htmx/index.html>`__ , you can create interactive user experiences while keeping most of your logic server-side. HTMX works by adding special attributes to your HTML elements that trigger HTTP requests when certain events occur. 
Django then processes these requests and returns HTML fragments that HTMX seamlessly incorporates into the page.

This approach offers several benefits: it reduces the complexity of building interactive applications, eliminates the need for a separate JavaScript frontend framework, 
maintains Django's templates as the single source of truth for your UI, and allows for progressive enhancement of your web applications. 
The result is a more maintainable codebase with less context-switching between languages and frameworks.

For developers familiar with Django's templating system, HTMX feels like a natural extension that brings modern interactivity without the overhead of a complex JavaScript ecosystem.
