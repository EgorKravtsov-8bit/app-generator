PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open-source scripting language especially suited for web development. 
Created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP is primarily designed to run on web servers, generating dynamic web page content before it's sent to the client's browser.

PHP code is typically embedded within HTML and executed on the server, with only the resulting HTML being sent to the client. 
This server-side processing allows PHP to perform database operations, file manipulations, and other server-side tasks while keeping the underlying code hidden from users.

Key features of PHP include:
----------------------------

- Easy integration with HTML
- Compatibility with all major web servers and operating systems
- Support for a wide range of databases
- Extensive standard library
- Object-oriented programming capabilities
- Large ecosystem of frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter)
- Massive community and documentation resources

Despite newer alternatives, PHP remains one of the most popular server-side languages, powering approximately 79% of websites with known server-side programming languages, 
including major platforms like WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia.
