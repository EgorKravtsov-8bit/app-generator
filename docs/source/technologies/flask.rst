Flask
=====================

Flask is a lightweight, micro web framework for Python. Created by Armin Ronacher, it's designed to be simple and extensible, allowing developers to quickly build web applications with minimal boilerplate code.   

Flask follows the "batteries included but removable" philosophy, providing a solid core with the flexibility to integrate various extensions as needed.
