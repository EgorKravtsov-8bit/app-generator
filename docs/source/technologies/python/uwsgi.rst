uWSGI
=====

uWSGI is a versatile and high-performance application server software that implements various protocols including WSGI, ASGI, HTTP, and more. 
It's primarily used to serve Python web applications, though it can also handle applications written in other languages like Perl and Ruby.

Key features of uWSGI
---------------------

1. **Python Web Server**: Its most common use is running Python web applications that follow the WSGI specification.

2. **Process Management**: uWSGI can manage multiple worker processes to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

3. **Protocol Support**: Besides WSGI, it supports HTTP, FastCGI, SCGI, and various other protocols.

4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with web servers like Nginx and Apache through dedicated modules.

5. **Load Balancing**: Provides built-in load balancing and routing capabilities.

6. **Emperor Mode**: Can manage multiple applications with different configurations.

7. **Advanced Features**: Offers memory profiling, request logging, and monitoring tools.

Common deployment architecture:

- Nginx/Apache as the front-facing web server
- uWSGI as the application server
- Your Python web application (Django, Flask, etc.)

A typical uWSGI configuration file (uwsgi.ini) might look like:

.. code-block:: ini 

    [uwsgi]
    http = :8000
    master = true
    processes = 4
    threads = 2
    module = myapp.wsgi:application
    virtualenv = /path/to/virtualenv

uWSGI is valued for its performance, stability, and extensive configuration options, making it a popular choice for deploying Python web applications in production environments.
