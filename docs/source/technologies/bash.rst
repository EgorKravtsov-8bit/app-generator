Bash
====

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell. It's the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.
Bash scripts can leverage a wide array of external utilities, support variables, arrays, functions, and command substitution, enabling users to automate complex workflows, 
perform system maintenance, and create sophisticated command-line tools.

**Key features of Bash**:

- Command-line interface
- Command history and editing
- Command completion
- Job control
- Shell functions and aliases
- Command substitution
- Piping and redirection

Bash is heavily used in server processing, Docker scripts, and administration tasks because is supported natively in all major Linux distros without any dependency.
