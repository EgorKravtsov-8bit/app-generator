Getting Started
---------------

Being a service founded since 2019, AppSeed can be used in many ways by developers, students and companies. 

The most popular action, here on AppSeed, is to find a `product </product/>`__ built with your favorite technology (**Django**, **Flask**, **NodeJS**, or **React**) and use it in a future product. 

.. include::  /_templates/components/signin-invite.rst


For instance, if the `products page </product/>`__ if filtered to show only `Django Starters </product/tags/django/>`__ , in the results we should see also Datta Able, a popular open-source template.
