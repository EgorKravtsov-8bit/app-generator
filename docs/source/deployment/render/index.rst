Prerequisites
-------------

Before deploying to Render, you'll need:

1. **A Render Account**: Sign up at `render.com <https://render.com>`__
2. **Git Repository**: Your code should be in a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository
3. **Python Project**: A working Python project with proper requirements
4. **Basic Git Knowledge**: Understanding of Git and how to push changes

Preparing the Project
---------------------

To ensure smooth deployment on Render, your Python project should include:

1. Requirements File
********************

Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all your Python dependencies:

..	code-block:: text

    Flask==2.0.1
    gunicorn==20.1.0
    psycopg2-binary==2.9.1

Or if using Poetry, ensure you have a `pyproject.toml` file.

2. Specifying Python Version
*****************************

Create a `runtime.txt` file to specify the Python version:

..	code-block:: text

    python-3.9.7


3. Procfile (for Web Services)
******************************

Create a `Procfile` that tells Render how to run your application:

..	code-block:: text

    web: gunicorn app:app


Replace `app:app` with your application's module and variable name. For example, if your application is in `main.py` and the Flask instance is called `application`, use `web: gunicorn main:application`.

4. Environment Variables
************************

Identify configuration that should be set as environment variables rather than hardcoded:
- Database credentials
- API keys
- Secret keys
- Environment-specific settings

5. Project Structure Example
****************************

A typical Python web project structure might look like:

..	code-block:: bash

    my_project/
    ├── app.py               # Main application file
    ├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
    ├── runtime.txt          # Python version
    ├── Procfile             # Process declarations
    ├── static/              # Static files
    └── templates/           # HTML templates


Deploying a Web Service
-----------------------

Step 1: Create a New Web Service
********************************

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub/GitLab account if not already connected
4. Select your repository

Step 2: Configure Your Service
******************************

1. **Name**: Give your service a name
2. **Runtime**: Select "Python"
3. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app` (or as specified in your Procfile)
5. **Instance Type**: Select your plan (Free, Starter, etc.)

Step 3: Advanced Options (Optional)
***********************************

1. **Environment Variables**: Add your secret keys, API tokens, etc.
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Configure if you want automatic deployments on push

Step 4: Create Web Service
**************************

Click "Create Web Service" and Render will start building and deploying your application.

Example: Deploying Flask
************************

..	code-block:: python

    # app.py
    from flask import Flask
    import os

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def hello():
        return "Hello from Render!"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # This is used when running locally
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080)))

With this `requirements.txt`:

..	code-block:: text 

    Flask==2.0.1
    gunicorn==20.1.0

And this `Procfile`:

..	code-block:: text
    
    web: gunicorn app:app


Deploying a Static Site
-----------------------

If your Python application generates static content (e.g., a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or a custom script):

Step 1: Create a New Static Site
********************************

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Click "New +" and select "Static Site"
3. Connect your repository

Step 2: Configure Your Static Site
**********************************

1. **Name**: Give your site a name
2. **Build Command**: Command to build your static files (e.g., `python build.py`)
3. **Publish Directory**: Directory where your built files are located (e.g., `build`, `dist`, `public`)

Step 3: Create Static Site
**************************

Click "Create Static Site" and Render will build and deploy your static content.

Setting Up a Database
---------------------

Render offers managed PostgreSQL databases:

Step 1: Create a PostgreSQL Database
************************************

1. From your dashboard, click "New +" and select "PostgreSQL"
2. Configure your database:
   - **Name**: Give your database a name
   - **Database**: Choose a database name
   - **User**: Create a database user
   - **Instance Type**: Select your plan
3. Click "Create Database"

Step 2: Connect Your Application
********************************

Render provides connection details (hostname, port, database name, username, password) that you'll need to use in your application. 

In your application, use the environment variable `DATABASE_URL` that Render automatically creates for services that need to connect to the database:

..	code-block:: python

    import os
    import psycopg2

    # Get the database URL from environment variable
    database_url = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')

    # Connect to the database
    conn = psycopg2.connect(database_url)

Using SQLAlchemy
****************

For Flask applications with SQLAlchemy:

..	code-block:: python 

    from flask import Flask
    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    import os

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

**Note**: Render's `DATABASE_URL` starts with `postgres://` but SQLAlchemy in newer versions requires `postgresql://`. You may need to modify the URL:

..	code-block:: python

    database_url = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    if database_url and database_url.startswith("postgres://"):
        database_url = database_url.replace("postgres://", "postgresql://", 1)
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = database_url

Background Workers
------------------

For long-running tasks or processing jobs that don't need to respond to HTTP requests:

Step 1: Create a Background Worker
**********************************

1. From your dashboard, click "New +" and select "Background Worker"
2. Connect your repository

Step 2: Configure Your Worker
*****************************

1. **Name**: Give your worker a name
2. **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Start Command**: Command to run your worker (e.g., `python worker.py`)
4. **Instance Type**: Select your plan

Example: Celery Worker
**********************

If you're using Celery for background tasks:

..	code-block:: python 

    # worker.py
    from celery import Celery
    import os

    app = Celery('tasks')
    app.conf.broker_url = os.environ.get('REDIS_URL')

    @app.task
    def process_data(data):
        # Process data
        return result

Your `Start Command` would be:

..	code-block:: bash
