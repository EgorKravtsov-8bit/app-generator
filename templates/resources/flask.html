    <u><a href="/docs/technologies/flask/index.html">Flask</a></u> is a lightweight 
    <u><a href="/docs/technologies/python/index.html">Python</a></u> Web Framework designed to make getting started with web development quick and easy, while still being powerful enough for complex applications. 
    Created in 2010 by Armin Ronacher as an April Fool's joke that evolved into a serious project, <strong>Flask</strong> is known for its simplicity and flexibility.

    Unlike Django's "batteries-included" approach, <u><a href="/docs/technologies/flask/index.html">Flask</a></u> follows a "bring your own tools" philosophy, giving developers more freedom to choose components that fit their specific needs. 
    This makes Flask ideal for smaller projects, APIs, microservices, and situations where customization is prioritized over convention.
